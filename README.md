# Project Update(inside mainCal folder)

The code and data have been updated. Please note that the program may not work with the default build settings in Qt Creator. 

## Build Instructions

To run the program, please follow these steps:

1. Change the build settings to use the Release build mode.
2. Disable Shadow Build.

Alternatively, you can directly use `qmake` and `make` from the terminal, which was the method used during development.
